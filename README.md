## Welcome to Martin Vrachevs portfolio

I am Martin Vrachev and I am finishing my bachelor degree in Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski".

I work for VMware as an Open Source software developer in Sofia Bulgaria.

Lately, I spent time on static code analysis tools focused on finding security vulnerabilities.

Also, I am learning about security, cryptography and cybersecurity.
